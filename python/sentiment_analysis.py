Conclusion-Based Sentiment Analysis Script for SchoolComm

This script uses your trained Random Forest model on your dataset to make direct conclusions
about feedback. The modal provides actionable conclusions based on the patterns learned
from your training data.

Usage:
    python sentiment_analysis.py "Text to analyze"

Returns:
